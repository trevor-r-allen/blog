Thankfully was able to get started on the frontend finally. After spending 2 weeks learning C#, working with Vue.js again felt much slower and less smooth than on previous checkpoints when it was fresh in my head. I had to reference syntax constantly. Was able to finish a few requirements and ended the day with the homepage displaying data and a basic layout for the home and profile pages. Still feeling behind where I need/want to be. Overall I feel like I didn't get much done today, especially in regards to requirements. Ended up focusing on css too much and sunk a lot of time into the modal layout in particular. Started to feel stressed out towards the end of the day. Kept thinking \"tomorrow it will be 'due tomorrow' \".")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=s.exports}}]);
